    <hr>
    <p>My name is Hunter Empey, I am a former cook and newly learning developer at Epicodus from Montana. My story with technology begins at around the age of 4 in 2006 when my parents first began to teach me how to use a computer on the then new site known as YouTube. It took some weeks of learning to get it down, but before we knew it I was a daily internet user, browsing the web and regularly getting kicked off for stumbling upon sites not made for kids. My experiences with tech early on would leave a strong impression on me, ultimately leading me to develop my current hobbies of internet browsing and video games, which in turn would help my tech skills and fuel my desire to learn coding. Despite my early exposure to tech, my experience with coding is currently still <span class = "redtext"><strong>limited</strong></span>, though <span class = "greentext"><em>I am learning.</em></span></p>
